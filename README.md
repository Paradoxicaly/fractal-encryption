# Fractal Encryption System

This repository contains the full Python implementation, LaTeX research paper, and supporting empirical results for a novel symmetric encryption system based on bounded fractal dynamics.

## Features
- **Post-quantum security:** Utilizes chaotic fractal functions for keystream generation
- **Python implementation:** Easily reproducible and extensible
- **Empirical validation:** Includes statistical randomness tests, entropy analysis, and visualizations
- **Formal security proofs:** Provided in the LaTeX paper appendix
- **Visual evidence:** Byte distribution and autocorrelation plots

## Contents

- `fractal_encryption_paper.tex` — Research paper (LaTeX)
- `byte_distribution.png`, `autocorrelation.png` — Visualizations
